## Options for benchmarking

### Mother Device w/Microchip
- This software could run on a mother device e.g. Raspberry Pi. `lb` would then have a benchmark written (by you or maybe you get lucky and find one) for a specific chip under test (CUT) or a device under test (DUT).
- **Note:** The benchmark written should be placed in the `platform/benchmarks` folder and follow the benchmark creation rules (need to be written â€“ see examples in the `python/benchmarks` folder for now).

### Benchmarking Single Board Computer
- Right now the software is written in Python, so as long as the device is running Linux and has Python installed, you could fire benchmarks off using `lb run MyBenchmark`.

# Goal

- Build a framework that makes microchip and Single Board Computer (SBC) benchmarking easier.
- Benchmark agnostic
- Support as many devices and platforms as possible.

# Inspiration
- [Phoronix Test Suite](http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/) (PTS) for PC benchmarking
- This [Sparkfun article](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/single-board-computer-benchmarks). Although, work had already started on `lb` prior to the article.
