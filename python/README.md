# Getting started

Little Benchmark has a few dependencies that make it tick.

To get these over to your system quickly, we've provided a handy shell script named `./give_me_lb` that does most of the installation work. Just run it in your favorite shell or terminal.

After the installation, you can run Little Benchmark using the activate script. Just run `./activate`. To exit, type exit.
